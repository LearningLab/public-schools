US Public Schools
================

This is a repository of basic information about US public schools and districts (including charters, magnets, etc). Our goal is to make basic school and district data more accessible and usable to citizens, journalists, researchers or anyone else interested in how public education works in the United States.

Data sources are being organized [on this Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgZ0ZPmeMXDkdDB4U3dGZ0hMcnpDTXdrNUhWMHgtOEE&usp=drive_web).

Scripts to scrape, clean, organize or otherwise manage data should go in the `scripts` folder.

Each state's data goes in its own folder.
